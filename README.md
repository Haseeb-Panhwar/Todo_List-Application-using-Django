This semester, I built upon my database and web application knowledge from my DBMS course by diving into Django. Dennis Ivy's insightful tutorials on Django's backend development approach were a great starting point.

To solidify my learning, I replicated one of Dennis's guided projects: a Todo application with some impressive features:

✅ Robust Login & Registration System 
✅ Interactive & Aesthetic GUI 
✅ User-friendly Warnings & Error Messages 
✅ Task Search Functionality

This project challenged me to:
1. Master Class-Based Views (CBVs): Building clean and powerful Django code.
2. CRUD Operations in Action: Adding, removing, and updating tasks efficiently.
3. Form View Expertise: Crafting a robust authentication system with informative messages.

Overall, it's been a fantastic learning experience exploring backend development with Django!
